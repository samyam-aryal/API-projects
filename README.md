## Description

This repository contains projects built using RestFUL APIs and Streamlit. APIs are essential tools that allow software applications to communicate and interact with each other. Through these projects, I learned how to integrate APIs into my projects, and also learned how to create a simple webapp using Streamlit.

## Projects

The projects you'll find in this repository are:

1. **FastAPI/app**
   A simple application using FastAPI that provides responses to HTTP requests.

2. **Streamlit**
   An application built using Streamlit that allows us to add records to two dataframes, stored in the csv files [employees.csv](https://github.com/samyam-aryal/API-projects/blob/main/Streamlit/employees.csv) and     
   [department.csv](https://github.com/samyam-aryal/API-projects/blob/main/Streamlit/department.csv). An option to join the two tables and view the joined records has been added.


Each project is contained in its own directory within this repository.
